['What is Lens? ðŸŒ¿']

['The Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain. It is designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph. The protocol is built from the ground up with modularity in mind, allowing new features and fixes to be added while ensuring immutable user-owned content and social relationships.']
['Lens Protocol seeks to solve major issues in existing social media networks. Namely, Web2 networks all read from their unique, centralized database. There is no portability. Your profile, friends, and content are locked to a specific network and owned by the network operator. This causes each network to fight a zero-sum game for your attention. ']
["Lens Protocol corrects this by being a user-owned, open social graph that any application can plug into. Since users own their data, they can bring it to any application built on top of Lens Protocol. As the true owners of their content, creators no longer need to worry about losing their content, audience, and livelihood based on the whims of an individual platform's algorithms and policies. Additionally, each application using Lens Protocol benefits the whole ecosystem, turning the zero-sum game into a collaborative one. Developers can design meaningful social experiences without needing to turn to feedback mechanisms to lock in a user's attention."]

['Introduction']

['This is a beta API']
['This API is beta and not production complete yet, which means that we could change schemas and endpoints at any time without warning or notice to you. When this API is production ready, we will remove this beta warning and will endeavor to ensure that there are no changes going forward unless a major change to the protocol itself is required.']
['Welcome to the API docs for Lens Protocol.  We aim to highlight all the endpoints which are exposed on the public API and explain how to use them and what they return. ']
['The API is a GraphQL API which is very similar to how a lot of people use the subgraph when using The Graph so it should be very familiar for many developers. If you have come from a REST backend we will explain how you can easily get up and running with this on your client.']
['GraphQL gives us a lot of benefits but the main one is a schema first approach. We believe for mass adoption and building of Lens we need the tools to be super easy and abstract away as much as the blockchain stuff as we can. You will see how we did this with our schema, everything should just make sense without having a deep technical understanding of how the protocol works or having to understand Solidity.']
['As the protocol data on the blockchain is very relational, our indexer does all the work for you. Mapping it into our Postgres database decoded and in a relational manner optimized for fast fetching. This allows you to query us with the same speed as if you were querying Twitter for example. ']
['We have packed the API with a lot of features and will be continuing to develop and improve it. By using this API in your application you automatically inherit many of these improvements.']
['We hope you like it and any feedback you have is extremely welcomed.']

['Profile']

['The Profile NFT is the main object in the Lens Protocol. It is ownership over this NFT that gives you control of your content. Individual addresses own ProfileNFTs, and an address can contain multiple ProfileNFTs. What differentiates the Lens Profile NFT from other on-chain identities is the ability to post ', ' to it. The Profile NFT contains the history of all of the posts, ', ', ', ', and other content you generate.']
['Additionally, Profile NFTs contain a ', '. This module contains the logic that allows different accounts to be issued Follow NFTs to record their relationship to the main profile on-chain.']
['Profiles can only be minted by addresses that have been whitelisted by governance. This ensures that, given the low-fee environment present on Polygon, the namespace is not reserved by squatters. If you are building an application on Lens that requires the minting of Profiles, please join the ', ' and get in touch!']

['Collect']

['Collects allow creators to monetize their content.  Because creators own their content via the Lens Protocol, they are able to allow their followers to purchase that content.']
['When a user posts a ', ' to their ', " they have the option to set a Collect Module. This module will allow other users to mint NFTs that link to the publication's ContentURI. This module can contain any arbitrary logic to apply to the minting process and the resulting NFT."]
['A creator can attach a collect module that allows collecting to be open for a certain amount of time or only allow a certain number of collects. Developers can also make their collect modules to add even more functionality!']

['Mirror']

["Mirrors are the curation tool of the Lens Protocol. They are the protocol's equivalent to reposting or re-amplifying content. Mirrors are treated the same as ", ' with a few additional checks and a few more minor features.']
["Since mirrors reference other publications, they are subject to the conditions of the original publication's Reference Module. If a publication has a reference module that limits mirrors only to accounts that follow the original poster, and the mirroring account does not hold a Follow NFT, the transaction to mirror will fail."]
['Since mirrors only repost existing content, they do not have a ContentURI field and therefore cannot be collected and do not have a Collect Module of their own. Mirrors can have their own reference module, which can define what accounts will be able to mirror or comment on the mirror.']

['Built-In Governance']

['Follow NFTs include built-in governance mechanisms -- any profile can spin up a DAO in minutes!']
['When following a profile, followers obtain a ', ' which is the core building block of the Lens Protocol social graph! From a technical perspective, these NFTs contain governance-specific logic that allows for the following:']
['Note that by default, delegation is inactive, so followers need to delegate, either to themselves or to another trusted user to partake in governance!']
["Now that's cool and all... But how do you ", ' this to build a ']
["To spin up a DAO, all you've got to do is deploy a contract that interfaces with the Follow NFT's built-in functionality. It should allow for proposal creation and interface with the given profile's Follow NFTs to read governance power at the appropriate blocks for voting -- that's it!"]
['In a nutshell, a governance contract would need to handle...']
["But this is just a basic list of requirements and only scratches the surface of what's possible!"]

['Community Multisig']

['To ensure the safety of the Lens Protocolâ€™s users and promote the development of a robust, constructive network, the protocol will be launched in a guarded manner, that is, controlled by a community multisig consisting of trusted parties throughout the Web3 ecosystem. The transition to multisig as well as the signers will be announced soon!']
['This multisig will be able to authorize the following actions: ']
['Notwithstanding its abilities, the multisig will not be able to do the following: ']

['Publication']

['Publications are the lifeblood of the Lens Protocol. They are all of the original content, comments, and mirrors produced by creators, curators, and users alike. Publications come in three primary types: posts, comments, and mirrors. Posts are the base object, with mirror and comment providing additional functionality. To learn more about ', ' and ', ' please go to their respective documentation pages.']
["Publications are posted directly to a user's ", '; this ensures that all content created by a user remains user-owned and in their wallet. Publications are ', " NFT's."]
['Publications have a ContentURI which points to the specific content the publication contains, this can point to text, an image, a video, or other arbitrary content stored on either a decentralized protocol such as ', ' or ', ', or a centralized storage provider like AWS S3.']
['Publications also have two attached modules, a Collect Module, and a Reference Module. The ', " contains the logic that allows other users to mint your publication into an NFT.

It contains the logic that determines who can ", ' and ', ' the publication.']
['Updated', ' ', '3 months ago', ' ']
['Comment']

['Comments allow users to provide additional commentary on other publications. They are treated the same as base ', " with extra checks and features. Like publications, comments live in the user's ", ' and therefore are wholly owned by the user.']
["Since comments reference other publications, they are subject to the original publication's Reference Module conditions.

['Follow']

['"Following" on the Lens Protocol differs from following in Web2 social applications. When users follow a profile on the Lens Protocol, they are given a Follow NFT, which creators and communities can encode with additional value. ']
[' can attach a particular Follow Module to each ProfileNFT, which contains all of the logic used to determine if a user attempting to follow the profile should be issued a Follow NFT. For example, a profile could attach a follow module that requires a user to pay 5 MATIC to receive a Follow NFT. ']
["The ID of each newly issued Follow NFT for given profile increments by 1, such that the first follower's NFT has an ID of 1; the tenth has an ID of 10, and so on. "]
['Additionally, Follow NFTs have built-in governance capabilities, such as vote delegation, to allow for the creation of Social DAOs using Lens Protocol. Creators, DAOs, or other organizations can create voting strategies using Follow NFTs and their various properties--for example: "The first 1000 follows have one vote each" or "The longer you have followed, the more voting power you have."']
['We look forward to seeing all of the new Follow Modules and Follower Governance strategies the community comes up with!']

['Overview']
[
['The purpose of the Lens Protocol is to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, decentralized social graph. This is achieved by allowing users to create profiles and interact with each other via these profiles. "Profile" (as used here) refers specifically to Lens profiles; "user" refers to standard crypto-wallets.']
['The protocol is built from the ground up with modularity in mind. Lens Protocol is currently overseen by a multisig, which will be expanded to a broader DAO, which can develop and vote on new modules and expanded functionality.']
["Let's first dig into profile creation and publishing. Users must create a profile on the hub, for which they will receive a sequentially ID'd profile NFT. This NFT controls the profile, and thus, its owner becomes the de facto controller of the given profile."]
['Profile owners can:']
['Regular wallets can:']
['The Lens protocol has three layers of tokenization via ERC721 NFTs. All three are ERC721-compliant and fully composable.']
['The ', ' upgradeable contract is the core entry point for the majority of interactions in the Lens Protocol. Nearly all interactions begin and doubles as the ERC721 NFT contract for profile NFTs, which are minted upon profile creation.']
["Upon a profile's first follow, a ", ' contract is deployed (via minimal proxy cloning), unique to the profile; this is the ERC721 NFT contract that represents follower positions.']
["Lastly, upon a publication's first collect, a ", ' contract is deployed (again, via minimal proxy cloning), unique to the publication; this is the ERC721 NFT contract that represents collected publications.']
['Note that follow and collect NFTs are deployed only upon the first follow/collect, respectively. This reduces gas overhead for profile creation.']
['Modularity is at the core of the Lens protocol. Everything is built with community expansion and the continued development of new, innovative features in mind.']
['Modules are standalone, governance-whitelisted contracts that adhere to a specific interface. They hold state and are unlimited in potential scope beyond adhering to the interface.']
['There are three types of modules:']
['The Lens Protocol is a composable social graph protocol built to be community-owned and ever-evolving. It empowers its users by allowing them to decide ', ' they want their social graph to be built and how they want it to be monetized, if at all. ']
["Furthermore, the protocol is engineered with the concept of modularity at its core, allowing for an infinitely expanding amount of use cases. This, from the user's perspective, translates to a new paradigm of ownership and customization that isn't possible (or financially feasible) in Web2."]
